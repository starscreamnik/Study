# Study
My public repository which has developments in the C++\C# language.

Currently the following projects are available:

*FullVector - Implementation of the class "FullVector". Methods that calculate scalar, vector and mixed products consistently and on the GPU.

*Parallel multiplication - Implementation of parallel and sequential calculations of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication.

*Parallel lightening - My view on image processing in .ppm format using CUDA

*File comparator - new C# work. I compare bitwise two files and output different bits. The output is formed from the parsing of optional parameters with the use of NDesk.options.

*Geometric figures - mini C# work. Shape's classes with methods: Area, Perimeter and Center(Mass center). Also i have class Menu for user interaction
