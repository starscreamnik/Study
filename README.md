# Study
My public repository which has developments in the C# language.

Currently the following projects are available:

*File comparator - new C# work. 
I compare bitwise two files and output different bits. The output is formed from the parsing of optional parameters with the use of NDesk.options.

*Geometric figures - mini C# work. 
Shape's classes with methods: Area, Perimeter and Center(Mass center). Also i have class Menu for user interaction

*Ratio - My realization of rational fraction.
I use unit testing with NUnit, this is debut. I think this skill will help me much more successfully in writing code more efficiently and faster.

*BitContainer - class for a low memory using bits through a List<byte>. 
Here, bit operations are implemented that provide access to a particular bit to get it\change it. There is index access and collection traversal.
